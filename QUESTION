Objective:
Develop a chatbot using AI and NLP techniques that can engage in a conversation with
users and provide meaningful responses.

Requirements:

1. Chatbot Functionality:
- Implement a chatbot that can understand and respond to natural language input from
users.

- The chatbot should be able to handle a minimum of three different conversation
topics or intents (e.g., weather information, FAQs, general chit-chat).
- Define appropriate user inputs that trigger each conversation topic.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- Utilize NLP techniques to preprocess and understand user messages.
- Implement a method for extracting relevant information or intent from user messages.
- Use a pre-trained NLP model or library (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) for language
understanding.

3. Response Generation:
- Generate meaningful responses based on user input and the identified intent.
- The responses should be relevant and contextually appropriate.
- Implement a variety of responses for each conversation topic to make the chatbot&#39;s
interactions more engaging.

4. User Experience:
- Create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot.
- Ensure that the chatbot provides clear and informative responses.
- Implement a conversation history feature that allows users to see past messages.

5. AI Training:
- Train the chatbot using a dataset or corpus relevant to the chosen conversation
topics.
- Fine-tune the chatbot&#39;s responses to improve its accuracy and relevance.
- Implement a method for continuous learning and improvement based on user
interactions.

6. Deployment:
- Deploy the chatbot on a web platform or as a standalone application.
- Provide clear instructions on how to access and interact with the chatbot.
