## **ChatBot Project**

Overview:-

This project aims to develop a chatbot using AI and NLP techniques to engage in conversations with users and provide meaningful responses.

Chatbot Functionality

The implemented chatbot can understand and respond to natural language input from users. It supports basic interactions such as responding to greetings (hi, hello), providing the current time, and sharing information about the weather.

Supported Commands
Greetings: The chatbot responds to greetings like "hi" and "hello."

Time: Users can inquire about the current time, and the chatbot will provide the current time information.

Weather: Users can ask about the weather, and the chatbot will respond with relevant weather information.

Example Conversations

User: hi
ChatBot: Hello! How can I assist you today?

User: What's the time?
ChatBot: The current time is [current_time].

User: How's the weather today?
ChatBot: I'm sorry, I don't have real-time weather data. Please check a weather service for accurate information.
